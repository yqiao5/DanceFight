    <p>Rewired features a player-centric input system. This means that generally all input is handled through the Player and not the controllers. You simply call <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetAxis.htm">player.GetAxis</a>, <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetButton.htm">player.GetButton</a>, etc. or register to receive input events with <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_AddInputEventDelegate.htm">player.AddInputEventDelegate</a> to get access to all input regardless of the input sources. For example, you may need to respond to input from the keyboard, mouse, any number of joysticks, and any number of <a href="CustomControllers.html">Custom Controllers</a>. This is handled simply by assigning the controllers and the appropriate maps to the Player and then getting the input directly from the Player. The input you receive from the Player is a combination of input received from all the assigned controllers. Additionally,  joysticks can (optionally) be intelligently auto-assigned to Players on connect and disconnect, so you don't have to worry about what controllers each Player owns. Instead, you simply get input for the specific Action you're looking for and Rewired handles the rest.</p>

      <p><strong>Creating / Editing Players</strong></p>
      <p>Players are created at runtime by the Input Manager in the scene. You must define Players in the Rewired Editor and assign maps to them in order for them to be created at runtime.</p>
      <p><strong>Accessing Players</strong></p>
      <p>The <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/T_Rewired_ReInput.htm">ReInput</a> class has methods to get access to a Player by id or name or to get a list of all Players. It's recommended you store a reference to the Player in  Awake and maintain that reference for the duration of the game. See <a href="HowTos.html#get-player">Getting a Player</a> for an example of how to get a Player.</p>

    <p><strong>System Player</strong></p>
<p>The System player exists an an option for handling system Actions such as Save, Load, etc. You can assign controllers and maps to the System player just as with any other player. Joysticks are not auto-assigned to the System player.</p>
    <p><strong>Players and Controller Maps</strong></p>
    <p><a href="ControllerMaps.html">Controller Maps</a> are what associates controller elements to Actions. As Rewired is a player-centric input system, controller maps aren't stored in the controller, but rather in the Player. This has the benefit of allowing you to share controllers among as many Players as you want while each maintains its own separate set of maps.</p>
    <p>The <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/T_Rewired_Player.htm">Player</a> class contains many methods for getting, adding, and removing all types of controller maps. (Access these methods through the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/F_Rewired_Player_controllers.htm">Player.controllers</a> helper object.) Additionally, assignment conflict checking and saving/loading maps is handled through the Player class.</p>
    <p>Even if a controller is assigned to a Player, if no maps are assigned, no input will be possible. You should define starting maps for joysticks, the keyboard, and the mouse for each Player in the <a href="RewiredEditor.html">Rewired Editor</a>. You can also load and assign maps during runtime through scripting via the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/?topic=html/T_Rewired_Player.htm">Player</a> class. </p>
